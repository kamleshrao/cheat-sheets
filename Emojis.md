# Emoji's

Markdown supports emojis just like regular text — as long as the platform you’re using (like GitHub, Discord, Obsidian, etc.) supports emojis, you can just copy-paste them directly.

`Notes`:

- Just copy and paste the emojis into your Markdown file — no need for escape characters.
- For unsupported emojis like 1️⃣1️⃣ and 1️⃣2️⃣, you can also just write 11 and 12 if rendering breaks on your platform.
- Test rendering on your specific platform — for example, GitHub fully supports all these.
